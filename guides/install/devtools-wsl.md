These are the instructions for setting up a development environment using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). We peppered the installation instructions with <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg"></i> __Check__ steps that confirm your progress through the steps. Use each to validate a step before moving on.  If you hit a snag, stop and reach out (forum, office hours) and we can help you out!

You may need to restart your computer a few times throughout this process, so itâ€™s a good idea to save all work before starting so you can restart when prompted.

## Requirements
> __Got WSL?__ By now you should already have installed WSL, if you don't, please first follow the [WSL installation guide](../wsl-setup) first and then come back here to install the developer tools.
{: .callout-warning}

Run the commands below in your WSL terminal to confirm that you are running an appropriate version of Ubuntu and WSL.

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm Ubuntu and WSL version 1" %}
```console
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Release:        24.04
Codename:       noble
$ powershell.exe "wsl --list --verbose"
  NAME              STATE       VERSION
 *Ubuntu-24.04      Running     1
```
> __Be sure you have WSL version 1__
> WSL version 2 is not compatible with the tools we use in this course.
{: .callout-warning}

## Install developer tools
Run the commands below in your WSL terminal.

1. Install prerequisites and base toolchain.
```console
$ sudo apt install build-essential gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

1. Download archive of our custom debugger build and extract files into place.
```console
$ wget https://github.com/cs107e/homebrew-cs107e/raw/master/riscv64-gdb-wsl.tar.xz
$ sudo tar -xvf riscv64-gdb-wsl.tar.xz -C /usr/local/bin
$ rm riscv64-gdb-wsl.tar.xz  # remove archive, not needed
```

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm compiler and debugger with simulator" %}
```console
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc () 13.2.0
Copyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```

```console?prompt=(gdb),$
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb
GNU gdb (GDB) 13.2
... blah blah blah ...
(gdb) target sim
Connected to the simulator.
(gdb) quit
```
## Install xfel

Next, we need to install xfel (<https://github.com/xboot/xfel>), which is the tool that we use to communicate with your Pi (i.e., send code and other nifty tricks).

Here are the steps:

Note that all terminal commands below are to be entered in the __wsl__ terminal.

1. Run these commands to download our xfel package.
    ```console 
    $ cd /mnt/c/Users/[your Windows user name]
    $ wget https://github.com/cs107e/homebrew-cs107e/raw/master/xfelWin32.tar.gz
    $ sudo tar -xvf xfelWin32.tar.gz # sudo here to gain permissions to modify the file time
    $ rm xfelWin32.tar.gz # remove archive, not needed
    ```
2. Use the command below to run "zadig-2.8.exe". When alert pops up to ask that the application is allowed to make changes to your device, click "yes".
    ```console
    $ powershell.exe "./xfel/zadig-2.8.exe"
    ```

3. Find the window that looks like screenshot below. Click "Create New Device" under the "Device" menu. Add "Mango Pi" as the description text and enter `1F3A` `EFEB` for the USB ID.  Click "Install Driver". You should see a progress meter that says "Installing Driver..." and once that finishes running, confirm there is a message that says the driver was installed successfully. Close zadig. If instead there are errors, call over a staff member for help.

    ![zadig.exe popup](../images/zadig.png){: .w-90}

4. Now we will create a symbolic link for the xfel executable. This allows us to keep the xfel executable in the Windows file system while still being able to call it from WSL (this arrangement avoids Windows Defender doing a painfully long antivirus scan everytime you run xfel!). Run the following commands:
    ```console
    $ cd xfel 
    $ sudo ln -s /mnt/c/Users/[your-Windows-username]/xfel/xfel /usr/local/bin
    ```

    If this worked, xfel will be findable on your path from the wsl side:
    ```console
    $ which xfel
    $ /usr/local/bin/xfel
    ```

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm xfel" %}

You can confirm xfel is properly installed by running the command below.

```console
$ xfel
xfel(v1.3.2) - https://github.com/xboot/xfel
usage:
    xfel version                            - Show chip version
    xfel hexdump address length             - Dumps memory region in hex
    xfel dump address length                - Binary memory dump to stdout
    ...
```

## Installation complete

Yay! If you made it this far, you should feel so proud! Head back to the [main installation guide](../devtools) to do one last set of checks.
