These are the instructions for setting up a development environment using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). We peppered the installation instructions with <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg"></i> __Check__ steps that confirm your progress through the steps. Use each to validate a step before moving on.  If you hit a snag, stop and reach out (forum, office hours) and we can help you out!

You may need to restart your computer a few times throughout this process, so itâ€™s a good idea to save all work before starting so you can restart when prompted.

## Requirements
> __Got WSL?__ By now you should already have installed WSL, if you don't, please first follow the [WSL installation guide](../wsl-setup) first and then come back here to install the developer tools.
{: .callout-warning}

Run the commands below in your WSL terminal to confirm that you are running an appropriate version of Ubuntu and WSL.

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm Ubuntu and WSL version 1" %}
```console
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Release:        24.04
Codename:       noble
$ powershell.exe "wsl --list --verbose"
  NAME              STATE       VERSION
 *Ubuntu-24.04      Running     1
```
> __Be sure you have WSL version 1__
> WSL version 2 is not compatible with the tools we use in this course.
{: .callout-warning}

## Install developer tools
Run the commands below in your WSL terminal.

1. Install prerequisites and base toolchain.
```console
$ sudo apt install build-essential gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

1. Download archive of our custom debugger build and extract files into place.
```console
$ wget https://github.com/cs107e/homebrew-cs107e/raw/master/riscv64-gdb-wsl.tar.xz
$ sudo tar -xvf riscv64-gdb-wsl.tar.xz -C /usr/local/bin
$ rm riscv64-gdb-wsl.tar.xz  # remove archive, not needed
```

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm compiler and debugger with simulator" %}
```console
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc () 13.2.0
Copyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```

```console?prompt=(gdb),$
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb
GNU gdb (GDB) 13.2
... blah blah blah ...
(gdb) target sim
Connected to the simulator.
(gdb) quit
```
## Install xfel

Next, we need to install xfel (<https://github.com/xboot/xfel>), which is the tool that we use to communicate with your Pi (i.e., send code and other nifty tricks).

Here are the steps:

1. Run the following command in **wsl** to download our version of xfel and its dependencies.
    ```console 
    $ cd /mnt/c/Users/[your Windows user name]
    $ wget https://github.com/cs107e/homebrew-cs107e/raw/master/xfelWin32.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvf xfelWin32.tar.gz
    $ rm xfelWin32.tar.gz # remove archive, not needed
    ```
2. Now we will run the "zadig-2.8.exe", when you enter the following command you will be asked if you want to allow the application to make changes to your device, click "yes".
    ```console
    $ powershell.exe "./xfel/zadig-2.8.exe"
    ```

4. By now, you should see a pop-up that looks like the below image. **Make sure your Mango Pi is plugged in for this part.** Click "Install Driver". You should get a pop-up on top that says "Installing Driver..." and once that finishes running, make sure you get a message that the driver was installed successfully. If not, make sure you call over a staff member. If so, you're good to go on!

    ![zadig.exe popup](../images/zadig.png){: .w-90}

5. Close zadig. Now we are going to create a symbolic link to the xfel executable, this allows us to keep the xfel executable in the Windows file system while still being able to call it from WSL (this way it avoids Windows Defender doing a very lengthy antivirus scan everytime you run xfel!). Run the following commands and copy the final output 
    ```console
    $ cd xfel 
    $ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/[your Windows user name]/xfel/xfel $CS107E/bin/ 
    ```

    If this worked, the following files should appear in your respository:
    ```console
    $ cd $CS107E/bin
    $ ls
    blink-actled.bin  mango-run  pinout.py  xfel
    ```

8. Time to check if that worked! Go back to your `mycode` folder, and try running xfel.

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm xfel" %}

```console
$ xfel
xfel(v1.3.2) - https://github.com/xboot/xfel
usage:
    xfel version                            - Show chip version
    xfel hexdump address length             - Dumps memory region in hex
    xfel dump address length                - Binary memory dump to stdout
    ...
```

## Installation complete

Yay! If you made it this far, you should feel so proud! Head back to the [main installation guide](../devtools) to do one last set of checks.
