[Glen A. Larson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_A._Larson),
the man responsible for producing
the original
[Battlestar Galactica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica)
and
[Knight Rider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_%281982_TV_series%29)
television series,
often used simple lighting effects in his shows.
One famous example is a scanner
that consists of a set of red LEDs that scan back and forth.
The front of the Knight Rider car had a scanner.

Watch this video tribute to Glen Larson.
How many times does the scanner pattern appear?

## Goals

When you're done with this assignment, you should

- be able to read and write simple programs in RISC-V assembly,
- feel comfortable with the RISC-V cross-development tools,
- know how to use breadboards and use LEDs,
- and be able to program general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins on the Mango Pi.

## How do assignments work?

The course follows a weekly cadence where material is introduced in the Friday-Monday lectures and the Tuesday-Wednesday lab follows up with hands-on guided practice so that you're ready to tackle the assignment which is released after the Wed lab. Completing the assignment will solidify your understanding of the topics.

Each assignment is structured into the core features and one or more proposed extensions. Completing the core functionality is required for all students; the extensions are the optional "stretch goals" for those students aiming to go further. We encourage everyone to try the extensions; they're a great way to challenge yourself and deepen your understanding.

> **YEAH = Your Early Assignment Help**  Each Thursday we'll hold a YEAH session as a kickoff for the week's assignment and more quality time with the CS107e family! We can answer your questions, inspire you about the new things you'll be learning, and facilitate a group brainstorm on best practices for success. YEAH hours for Assignment 1 are scheduled for __Thursday 6pm__ in B02. Everyone welcome!

## Core functionality: simple scan pattern

This assignment involves modifying the blink program showed in class and reviewed in lab.
`blink.s` is a RISC-V assembly language program that blinks a single
LED. You will extend the program to control four LEDs instead of just one.
Using arithmetic and loops, your assembly program changes which
LED is lit to show a scanner pattern.

### 1. Get starter files

Change to your local `mycode` repo and pull in the assignment starter code:

```console
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/mycode
$ git checkout dev
$ git pull code-mirror assign1-starter
```

Your repo should now be on the `dev` branch and should contain a new subdirectory named `assign1` containing the starter files. Change to that subdirectory and look around:

```console
$ cd assign1
$ ls
Makefile      README.md    larson.s
```
There are three files in the `assign1` directory:
- `larson.s`: an assembly language program.  This is the file you will edit to implement your Larson scanner.
- `README.md`:  a text file you can edit to communicate with the grader about your submission
- `Makefile`: this file contains the rules for how to build the larson program. This file is read by the `make` tool.


### 2. Wire up your breadboard, connect to Pi

The scanner should have a row of 4 LEDs. If you feel ambitious and want to make more interesting patterns, wire up 8 LEDs. Validate your breadboard wiring by testing that each LED lights up when powered.

Take the time to do a nice job building your breadboard! We want you to share our appreciation for breadboarding as art and craftsmanship. Secure your components close to the breadboard, snipping the ends to fit cleanly and using your pliers to make neat bends. Not only does this look nice, it makes your circuit easier to trace and debug as well as being more robust to being handled or knocked around in your kit box.

The leftmost LED in your scanner should be connected to gpio PB0 of your Mango Pi, the second from the left to PB1, and so on, such that the rightmost LED in your scanner is connected to PB3 (or PB7 if using 8 LEDs). Refer to your [refcard](/guides/refcard) to map each GPIO to the physical pin so that you correctly wire up the connections.

Share your creation with us by snapping a photo of your larson scanner hardware setup and copying it to the `assign1` directory of your `mycode` repo. Be sure to `git add` and commit the file so that it is included with your submission.

### 4. Confirm single blink

The code in the starter file `larson.s` is a copy of the blink program you studied in lab 1. This program configures the single pin PB0 as an output and enters an infinite loop to turn that pin on and off. Carefully review this code and be sure you understand how it accomplishes its tasks. Ask questions if anything is unclear!

Build and run the starter program on your hardware setup. The starter program should blink the leftmost LED of your scanner (PB0). The `make run` command will build the program and send it to the bootloader to run on the Pi shown below:

```console
$ make run
riscv64-unknown-elf-as larson.s -o larson.o
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy larson.o -O binary larson.bin
mango-run larson.bin
```

If you're wondering how `make` and makefiles work, sit tight. We have an lab exercise on makefiles coming up lab2.

### 5. Configure all scanner GPIOs

You will modify the program in `larson.s` to blink the scanner sequence, rather than the single LED.

A good first task is to configure as output all of the GPIOs used by your scanner, instead of just PB0. Recall that a GPIO's function is selected by modifying the associated bits in the `CFG` register for that pin index of the PB group. Refer to section 9.7 of the [D1 User Manual](/readings/d1-h_user_manual_v1.0.pdf#page=1083) for the details on the GPIO peripheral registers.

After writing your configuration code, add some test code to verify that this code works correctly. You can test an individual pin by changing the existing loop to blink PB1 or PB2 and so on instead of PB0. Once you have verified that all pins are properly configured, you're now ready to move on to blinking the pins in the scanner sequence.

> __Commit yourself to regular commits__ Our strong recommendation is that you make a habit of regular git commits. A commit takes a snapshot of your changes and records them into your repository history. This takes a snapshot that allows you to later return to this version if need be. When should you commit? Any time you hit an "interesting" point in your development: after achieving a milestone, before stopping for break, after fixing a bug, before embarking on an exploratory path, and so on. Be sure to include a descriptive message with each commit. Following up a commit with `git push` will sync your local repository to your GitHub remote repository.

### 6. Generate scanner pattern

The scanner loop should scan back and forth from the leftmost to rightmost LED. Each iteration of the loop still turns on/off one GPIO, but instead of blinking the same GPIO each time, it will blink the next GPIO pin in sequence.

The scanning pattern should move smoothly back and forth. In particular, exactly one LED should be on at any given time, so the light appears to be "moving" between LEDs. Make sure you handle the left and right
ends properly (that is, the leftmost and rightmost LED should be each
on for the same amount of time that a middle LED would be on). The scanning frequency should be around 1Hz (that is, the light should bounce back and force about once per second).

Here is a video clip of an 8-LED scanner:

Writing clean, readable assembly code is a challenge. __Commenting is essential__!
Because you don't yet know how to write functions in assembly, you must
write your program without them.  You otherwise have the full range of RISC-V assembly at your disposal; keep our [one-page guide](/guides/riscv-onepage) on hand as a quick reference.

A branch instruction is the assembly equivalent of a goto (a practice long considered harmful <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful>), and code with lots of branches can be hard to debug and follow.
Straight-line code is code without branches and is almost always easier
to understand. However, a downside of a straight-line approach is that you may end up with duplicated code. There is a tension here between less code and clearer code. For this first assignment, prioritize writing code that can be easily understood, whether it's by you six months from now
or by us in a week when we grade your assignment.

Congratulations on completing your first step on the path to bare-metal mastery!
Sit back and enjoy the show by turning off the lights and impressing your
friends.

## Submitting
The starter files for each assignment include an empty `README.md` file for communicating with the grader. Edit this file to pass along whatever information you'd like:
'I added an extension that implements feature X' or 'There is a lurking bug in function Y that I need help to resolve' or 'I am really proud of this neat thing Z I did in my code'. The file may also be left blank.

> **Note** Make sure that you also cite any help that you receive, either in the `README.md` or as comments in your code, as explained in the [collaboration policy](/policies/#collaboration-policy).
{: .callout-warning}

The submit checklist in the [Git Workflow Guide](/guides/cs107e-git#assignment-checklist) has the final steps: __tag__ your
submit, __push__ to sync with your remote repo, and ensure you have an open __pull request__ on GitHub.

The assignment is due at **5pm on Tuesday.** The timestamp on the tagged commit determines the submission time.  Delivering on schedule earns a small on-time bonus. We encourage you to learn how to pace your work and hit the deadline -- this is a great skill to build! Finishing on time also allows you a short breather before the next assignment comes out. If you are running a a bit behind in a given week, there is a 48-hour grace period where we accept late submissions without penalty (but with no on-time bonus). Read more about the [late policy](/policies/#late-policy).

## Extension

If you enjoyed the core assignment portion and want to explore further, we encourage you to tackle the extension. The extension is more challenging, and will involve further explorations of RISC-V assembly and writing more complicated code.

Your extension will build on your core implementation in the same `larson.s` file. As such, we'll expect that your extension implementation works as well, or better, than your core implementation.

If you watch the Larson scanner carefully,
several LEDs are turned on at once.
The center one is at full brightness,
and the ones on the edge are dimmer.
How would you dim an LED? Your challenge for the assignment extension is to
implement a scanner with LEDs aesthetically dimmed
in a way that would please Glen Larson.

The extension requires 8 LEDs. There is a full-brightness LED in the center scans back and back just as
in the core version, but you should visibly dim the
neighbors of that central light as it moves. Aim for a look similar to
the
[Larson Scanner Kit Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYawDGDsmjk).

You should have at least three distinct levels of brightness (not including "zero brightness," or the lights that are off).

This fancy code will surely require some top-notch comments that thorougly explain how it works!

Before starting on the extension, be sure you have completed all core tasks, including commit, tag, and push of your finished scanner. This ensures your submission tag is a known good place that can be a fallback if the extension doesn't pan out. 

When working on the extension, follow the same git workflow as core (edit on dev branch, make regular commits and pushes). When you have successfully completed the extension, tag your final commit with `assign1-extension` and push to indicate that your extension is ready to be graded.

## Grading

Our general process for grading assignments focuses on evaluating the __functionality__ and __quality__ of your submission. For functionality, we assess the completeness and correctness of the implementation of required features. We run tests against the code for a variety of situations and report results to you in terms of passed and failed test cases. Quality comprises an evaluation of the design of your implementation, style and readability of your code, and thoroughness of your test cases.  We evaluate quality through an individual review and provide qualitative and constructive feedback.

To grade your Larson scanner, your beloved CAs will invoke `make` to build your `larson.bin`
file and test it on a Pi with the LEDs connected to the PB group pins. For this process to go smoothly,
please ensure the following:

- A `make` will successfully build your program with no warnings or errors.
- Your scanner uses pins PB0-PB3 or PB0-PB7 (depending on how many LEDs you chose to use).

While grading, we'll be checking for the following criteria to be met:

- 4-8 LEDs that individually light
- Scanning pattern is even and smooth
- Scans in both forward and reverse direction
- Reverse at end is handled correctly (no duplicate or skipped LEDs)
- For extension: at least three differentiated levels of brightness, scanning has pleasing ramp and smoothness

For more long-winded information on grading and course policy, see our pages on [assignments](/assignments/#faq) and [course policies](/policies).
